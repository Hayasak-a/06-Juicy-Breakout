# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This is an opportunity for you to implement some of the "juicy" features as demonstrated in the 2012 GDC presentation, "Juice it or Lose it."

I have provided a simple, generic brick breaker game, built in Godot. You can use the presentation as a guide or use your own imagination, but your assignment is to make the game feel more "juicy": kinetic, reactive, physical.

Features implemented:
1. Tiles have a random color for each run of the game
2. Paddle changes to ball's color when hit; ball's color changes to random color when hits a tile
3. Ball rotates
4. Blocks fall when hit; don't just disappear
5. Paddle changes to ball's color when hit 
6. Ball increases speed on tile hits
7. "Pause" superpower helps on nigh impossible speeds: once per life, click to pause game for one second
8. "You win" and "Game Over" text no longer look godawful; new font/color/size/rectangle color
9. Music
